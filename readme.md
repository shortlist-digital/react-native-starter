# React Native Starter

Starting point for react native apps

## Todo:

 - [Routing](https://github.com/t4t5/react-native-router)

Used [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) to get started with routing

 - Scripts for renaming the project

[Follow instructions in this article](http://jslim.net/blog/2015/01/08/how-to-rename-xcode-project-thoroughly/)

You will also want to change the name in the ```AppDelegate.m``` file in Xcode. Scroll down and look at the ```RCTRootView``` and you want to change the line ```moduleName:@"ReactNativeStarter"``` to the name of the project you want.  

After this quit the terminal that the app opened up earlier as this localhost:8081 will be poiting to the wrong place. Then run the app again, restarting a new localhost:8081 server.

 - Instructions on how to setup the project in Xcode

 Open the project ```ReactNativeStarter.xcodeproj``` in the ```ios``` directory and run the project (cmd + r). I have no idea how they do but this will automatically set up a localhost and start running on your selected Simulator.
